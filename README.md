LSTM, or Long Short-Term Memory , is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used primarily in deep learning for processing and 
predicting sequential data, such as time series, language, and audio data. Developed to overcome the limitations of standard RNNs, 
LSTMs excel in handling long-term dependencies in data, which makes them particularly valuable for applications where the context 
from earlier in a sequence is crucial for predictions.
